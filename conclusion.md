# Conclusion

Ethical AI has been a discussion since the term AI was first introduced and now that we are at the dawn of AI it is important that we keep in mind the ethics of AI. Without doing this AI could be just as much of a dangerous tool as it is benificial. To negate this problem many experts are suggesting a pause in AI development in order to work with policy makers to create proper guidelines. Doing so will allow us the build a safer and better future with AI. 

## What is being done right now

At the moment of this writing [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) CEO of OpenAI appeared in front of congress to call for the US to regulate Artificial Intelliegence. This is a very important step in the right direction and it could change the current path AI is on. This appearance has been seen as a wake up call in the industry with many companies changing their strategy in order to build safer AI.



## Closing

Overall AI is a very powerful tool but in order for humanity to gain all the benifits of it we need to create proper guidelines. If we dont the consequences would be disastrous.
